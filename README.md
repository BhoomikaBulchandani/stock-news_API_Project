# stock-news_API_Project
This project is made to use the knowledge of api keys and authentication.
I've used the stock api from alphavantage and the news from newsapi.
You can access free api for student developer purposes so it is suggested to visit the sites and generate the api keys of your own.
This code can be changed for any stock company , i've used tesla as an example.
To check if the code is working, the difference percent is set as per the current prices but this project is made to see significant changes.
I was comfortable to work with emails, you can also use sms.
